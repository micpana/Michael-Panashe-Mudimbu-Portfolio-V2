            A React Native mobile application designed for efficient farmer data collection and management. The app supports two user roles: Clerks, who input farmer details (name, national ID, farm type, crop, and location), and Admins, who configure form options. Built with offline functionality, it stores data locally in SQLite and syncs with a Flask-based backend using MongoDB when an internet connection is available. Secure authentication ensures role-based access, and the system provides a seamless user experience for agricultural data management.

Designed for Android devices, the app uses artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision to analyze user-uploaded selfies and diagnose various facial skin conditions such as acne and eczema.

            The AI also determines the user's skin type (dry or oily) and provides tailored product recommendations based on the identified skin issue. Beyond product suggestions, the app offers instructional content on how to properly apply and use the recommended skincare solutions.

            Skin Sage empowers users with valuable insights into their facial skin health, including potential issues, skin type, and personalized skincare routines.
